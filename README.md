# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


In this app I learn:
- React 18 and its latest features
- React hooks and state management
- Easy maintainable and scalable folder structure
- How to make global state containers with Redux Tookit
- How to fetch data from Rest API with Axios 
- How to create custom hooks
- How to create carousel/slider without library
- How to create Infinite scrolling
- React Router DOM Version 6
- Loading Skeleton while fetching data from API
- Error handling & 404 forbidden page
- Responsive layout with perfectly placed media queries
